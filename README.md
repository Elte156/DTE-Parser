# DTE Parser

Parse your energy usage provided by [DTE Energy](dteenergy.com) and see a cost analysis to help you understand which electric plan is best for you.

Live Site: [DTEParser.netlify.app](https://dteparser.netlify.app)

The goal is to create a site that can:

- Accept a CSV file upload of energy usage and perform calculations
- Show estimated costs of each type of offered DTE Energy plan based on actual energy usage
- Compare existing energy costs with a flat rate per KwH.
